# Messegger

A Discord bot dedicated to providing the best message moderation and logging experience. Add the bot to your server [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1226243129733156906&permissions=0&scope=bot).

The public bot's operation and its uptime, while it's still being added to its first servers, is not guaranteed. Join the [Messegger Discord server](https://discord.gg/rWVHU3qjvK) for any updates about the project.

## Features

### Currently supported

- **Message Logging** - log edited and deleted messages in a dedicated channel.
- **Persistent Messages** - store new, edited, and deleted messages in its own database for an improved logging effectiveness.
- **Sniping** - snipe the latest deleted message from a channel.

### Planned features

- **Persistent Attachments** - store a copy of message attachments as to not rely on Discord's auto-expiring CDN.
- **Translator** - translate messages to any supported languages.
- **Web Access** - the Messegger project has a registered domain name `messegger.xyz`, which will be used to have more control over providing a much richer view of message logs. And a dashboard, but that's probably for a v2.
- And much more...

### Planned improvements

- Learn more about the complex system of interaction commands to properly organize commands and improve their convenient use.
- And much more...
